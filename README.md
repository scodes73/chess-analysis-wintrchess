# Free Chess Analysis with Wintrchess

This chrome extension will help you analyze your chess.com games on wintrchess. Just click the icon in your extension bar when you're on a chess.com game and a new wintrchess tab will open with your game.


## How It Works

-   User clicks the extension icon when on a page like `chess.com/game/live/*`
-   The extension gets the pgn from chess.com share option.
-   The extension creates a new tab with url `wintrchess.com/analysis` and imports your game.
-   The extension will automatically start analysis and also flip the board if you were black.
